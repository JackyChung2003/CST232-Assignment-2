    "The worst-case seek time remains constant at 448 cylinders for all sets of requests. This is because the worst-case scenario in C-LOOK is determined by the furthest request from the current head position, and since the disk size and head position are constant, the maximum possible seek distance doesn't change.\n",

This makes it suitable for systems where minimizing the disk arm movement is crucial for performance."
